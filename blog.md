Other news:

* A photograph of mine, the black and white hand at the window on my portraits page, was shortlisted by Rankin for this new Rankin's 2020 SkyArts television series broadcast on 29th September 2020.  It ran for 6 weeks. The series captured the spirit of 2020. That image also appeared in the book 'Rankin's 2020' that was published in December 2020. https://www.2020rankin.com/the-book
All profits from the book go to Mental Health UK.
