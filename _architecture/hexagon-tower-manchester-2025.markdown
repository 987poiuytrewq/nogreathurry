Detail shot of Manchester's Hexagon Tower. Completed in 1973 for ICI. 

For 50 years this Brutalist building’s facade was of concrete. The facade was over-clad with insulated aluminium rainscreen in 2023/2024, retaining the hexagonal shape of the original structure’s windows.

The 14-storey tower was named after the hexagon shaped windows based on the chemical compound Benzene, which is widely used in the creation of synthetic dyes.

Original architect was Richard Seifert.
